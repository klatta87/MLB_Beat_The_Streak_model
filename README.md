This is a place for me to store the code involved in building a predictive model for how  
to choose players for MLB's Beat The Streak game.

###April 4, 2025 Thought:
There are really two types of good BTS picks/players:
  1. Those who are steady-eddies:
     * Good contact guys. High z-swing. Your Arrayes, Kwan, Bichette, TA7 guys.
  2. You guys who are hot: on a heat. Streaky guys.
     * Your Bellingers, Judges, VLAD.
You gotta make up your mind who your choosing. When to Ride the heater. When it ends.
High Variance guys. - When to they fail...END their streaks
Low Variance guys. When do they fail...off days.
